## **Basemap Design Using Mapbox**

**Christmastide**

For this basemap, I wanted to make one which captures a classic Christmas theme. I used the classic red and green Christmas colors, but I chose to use less saturated colors as to not distract too much, and also to make the overall
map more down to earth and pleasant to look at. For the ground and the water, I used a white color, so make the map
 have a snowy feel. To develop the color palette, I used a couple websites which were very helpful: 
https://www.canva.com/color-palette/ and https://coolors.co. I also used a fount which I thought looked very classic 
and traditional, which made the map have that classic Christmas feel.

**Rustic Celtic Isles**

For the Rustic Celtic Isles basemap my goal was to develop a map which had a more rustic mediaeval feel and displayed 
a Celtic Irish theme. To emulate the older styled maps, I only used one hue for the water and the land, while changing 
the brightness so that they can be differentiated. I used a light to dark olive green to display the text and road
 features. This map is simpler in that I used very few hues, but the simplicity I thought was key make the map achieve 
a more rustic impression.
